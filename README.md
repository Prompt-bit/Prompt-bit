### Hi there 👋

I'm Prompt from Thailand, and I make websites using HTML, CSS and JavaScript I sometimes use React with TypeScript or JavaScript but the one I love most is TypeScript. I really enjoy writing code in my favorite code editor available for download on Windows and Mac called Visual Studio Code. I also enjoy markdown which is everything you got to know to get started writing documentations on Github.
